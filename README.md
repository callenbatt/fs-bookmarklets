# fs-bookmarklets
Scripts run in bookmarks to automate Composer admin tasks

## About
Certain administrative tasks require multiple clicks to complete, and can lead to tedium if the same task needs to be repeated multiple times. 

Bookmarklets are a way for small snippets of JavaScript stored in a bookmark in the browser to run on the page. This allows these tasks to be completed in one click instead instead of several. 

This library holds a few of the more common tasks admin perform inside of Composer. 

## Steps
1. Open the `minified bookmarklets` folder in this repository, and click on a file you'd like to use
2. Copy the entire contents of a file, which is one line of JavaScript
3. Open your browser, select the option to add a bookmark, and paste the code from your clipboard into the URL field. Be sure that it still starts with `javascript:` in order for it to run, sometimes this part is stripped out when the code is pasted in. 
4. In Composer, click the bookmark to execute the code. 

## Notes
All code is available uncompressed in the `uncompressed files` folder. All files are compressed using [jscompress.com](https://jscompress.com)
